## IMPORTANT PLEASE READ AND MAKE NOTE

This repository will contain several Android Projects - but Android Studio **can** only contain a single project at a time. 
This will mean that to work correctly with this repository.

1. Clone in the first instance through the Command Window
2. Open project folders directly in Android Studio
3. It is recommended that git commands are entered via the terminal window - **do not initialise repositories in 
subfolders** as the top-level folder is managing commit history
4. It is intended that each Project is worked on as a separate branch - you will see these via Github or by doing a **git branch --all** 
command in the terminal window.
5. This means that you need to switch to the approriate branch when working on a project. Please try your best to stick to these branches.
6. Once a project has been finished (core + extension), 'Create a Pull Request' and merge back to main on Github.

***Folder Explanation***

Each folder contains a starting Android Studio Project that has been initialised with the current version of Hedgehog (2023.1.1). 
Inside each folder is a README.md file that provides more information about the task. 

**Component 1** consists of 8 projects that map to the Google Codelabs exercises. Completing each exercise will receive 3 marks, 
with a further 2 marks based on the commit history. The history (commit messages) should contain meaningful information 
pertaining to the commit.
