***Folder Explanation***

REQUIRED WORK

Please make sure that you have a commit point that matches the end of the exercise and will produce the following 
screenshot when complete. (This is the Light Theme render of the final application)

EXTENSION

To extend the exercise, make the list item **clickable**. Clicking the ListView should open a Toast and a Dialog view 
from the selected affirmation. The expected behaviour is in the final screenshot. The previous 2 show each individual 
additional view element.


|            **Click - Toast Message**             |                **Click - Dialog**                 |                **Click - Toast + Dialog**                 |
