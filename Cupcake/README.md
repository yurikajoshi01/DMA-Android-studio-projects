***Folder Explanation***

REQUIRED WORK

Please make sure that you have a commit point that matches the end of the exercise and will produce the following 
navigational sequence as shown in the screenshot.

EXTENSION

To extend the exercise, insert an extra page (Route/View). This should be a CHOOSE TOPPING Page and will appear after the
CHOOSE FLAVOR. The sequence should then continue. A topping should have a price applicable per cupcake which is reflected 
in the calculated price.
