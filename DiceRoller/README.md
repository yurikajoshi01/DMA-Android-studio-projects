***Folder Explanation***

REQUIRED WORK

Please make sure that you have a commit point that matches the end of the exercise and will produce the following 
screenshot when complete - the roll button when clicked will change the number on the dice.

EXTENSION

To extend the exercise, add a second dice to the screen. The roll button will roll both dice. If a double is rolled, a
message appears. Orientating the device retains the current state of the dice. Please make sure that you have a 
commit point that matches the end of the exercise, and will produce the following behaviour.


|                     **No double rolled**                     |                    **A double rolled**                    |
