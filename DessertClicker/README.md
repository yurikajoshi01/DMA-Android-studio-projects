EXTENSION

The extension for this exercise is to complete:

https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-practice-viewmodel#0

This changes the prior example from using **rememberSaveable** to a **ViewModel Class**.
Please make commits at appropriate steps. The final views will be the same, as it is just the way that the model is 
being accessed is changed.


|                   **Portrait**                   |                    **Landscape**                    |
